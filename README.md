Awesomeness


[IPFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System) + Tobias TrustyURI blah = TRUSTED LINKED DATA (this will be a seal of approval)
Embed trust in HTTP headers of request and response. You can ask for verification and get a status code that tells you if it’s verified!
Eval: measure performance, threshold of how much you need to put into the IPFS to have “enough” trust
Consider: protocol of requests, you don't want the last one coming from the server

## TODO
- [] Read on conceptual, basic functioning of [IPFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System)
- [] Check out the [Python](https://github.com/ipfs/py-ipfs), [JS](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs) and [Go](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs) (most mature) implementations
- [] Idea is to build either a wrapper around [rdflib](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib), or use the JSON helper functions to get JSON-LD into IPFS
